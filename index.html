        <p>Winter Guard is artistic sport that is similar to marching band, but it done inside a gym to recorded music. Winter guard groups range
            in different levels from novice to world class, and are divided into two categories: scholastic and independant. A show is between
            3 to 7 minutes, and usually has a theme or story and can be done to any type of music or sound. There are three main pieces of 
            equipment that are used in winter guard, as it grew out of the military drill team tradition:
            <ul>
                <li>Flag</li>
                <li>Rifle</li>
                <li>Sabre</li>
            </ul>
            At Lincoln High School, our Winter Guard is currently preparing for our 2021-2022 season... if any of the above looks like something you want 
            to learn how to do, fill out the information page! We'd love to have you join our team!
