        <p>Abby Heiser graduated with an art degree from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 
        and enjoyed five seasons as a color guard member in the Cornhusker Marching Band. 
        She was a member of the leadership in her final year in the CMB and enjoyed helping 
        the members of her rank practice and grow as performers. Her favorite part of being a 
        coach is having the opportunity to pass on her love of color guard to a new generation, 
        and being able to teach her guard members choreography, artistic expression, coordination, 
        responsibility, and the value of team work. In her free time, Abby loves to read and 
        make art, or spend time with her two cats, Quinn and Corncob.
